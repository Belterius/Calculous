# Calculous
This application was realised to allow young (6-7 years old) French students to practise English and mental arithmetic.

This application display a simple math operation, that can be composed of one or two operators (x, -, +).  
The math operation is orally spoken to the user, in English.  
The user should enter the operation result.
If the correct result is entered, the user is congratulated by a success sound, and the display of a "Congratulation !"
If the wrong result is entered, a fail sound is played, and the correct result is displayed.  
A player can stop to play at any moment by going to the Score Screen, that will display the total number of correct answer.
The user can then choose to Play Again or Quit.
